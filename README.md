# Predictive Maintenance in Manufacturing — Demonstration Use Case

## 1. Business Overview
- Short context of predictive maintenance in manufacturing  
- Why failure prediction matters  
- Expected business impact (reduced downtime, improved OEE, lower repair cost)

## 2. Problem Statement
- Define what the model predicts  
- Define industry best-practice approach  

## 3. Dataset Description
- Source (Kaggle or other)  
- Key features (sensor readings, cycle count, temperature, vibration, etc.)  
- Target variable (failure yes/no OR failure type OR RUL)

## 4. Approach & Architecture
- Data → Preprocessing → Model → Evaluation → Deployment flow diagram  
- Rationale for intermediate complexity  

## 5. Model Training Summary
- Feature engineering  
- Algorithms used (RandomForest / LightGBM)  
- Evaluation metrics  

## 6. Demo Application UI
- Streamlit UI to simulate predictions  
- How to run the UI locally or on Colab  

## 7. How to Run This Project
- Steps to run notebook  
- Steps to run training script  
- Steps to run UI  

## 8. Mini Deployment Notes
- How this would be deployed in a real factory IT/OT environment  
- API notes + monitoring notes
